                        In the words and wisdom of the intellectual, Chanakya, a King is respected only in his kingdom, while the scholastic prowess of an astute scholar is revered everywhere. We, Pragati Classes, subscribe to this school of very school of thought. The youth
                        of the Nation are the children of immortal bliss, and have the potential to change the world in ways unimaginable, given the nurturing and mentoring that they need and deserve – and incidentally, that they lack. Innumerable are
                        the promising young minds who ardently desire to study ,but are destitute, and lack the finances and means to send them to centres of learning.

                        We all know that Kota, Rajasthan is known as the engineer and MBBS producing factory in India. But why to go Kota when you have best coaching experience here itself in your own town? Our notes and study material are well designed to give you complete
                        experience of Competitive exams like NEET, JEE, CEE and what not? For the betterment of the students we have designed our modules as per top coaching institutes of India(particularly Kota). We have in fact spent a lot regarding
                        this matter. So, there’s nothing to worry regarding the study materials, they are designed taking reference from the modules of Allen-Resonance-Cengage(The top Coaching institutes). We also have mentorship plan that is, 3 student
                        per mentor. Thus ensuring that each student gets equal importance and gets a better understanding of each topics. JEE ,NEET all the national level exams are conducted in CBT mode .But most of the coaching institutes, even the top
                        ones (let it be in Barak Valley or any other part of India), prefers pen-paper mode, so students generally face problems and thus commits blunder mistakes during the most crucial day of their life and so score sometimes low on
                        the very day of exam. So in order to avoid this situations we will provide our students with CBT exam mode(Computer based mode). We have a number of cells, where more than 20 management staffs are working day and night for the
                        classes such as exam control cell, software maintenance cell, result declaration cell, web development and management cell, editorial and innovation cell and most importantly the students welfare development cell. The students
                        welfare development cell will not only look after the academic issues of the student but will guide the students to tackle problems of their day to day life so that they can stick to their goals and achieve success.
