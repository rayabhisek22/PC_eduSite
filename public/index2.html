        <p>
          With the same motto Pragati classes was started. We have our vision
          and objectives like -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To Empower students to build stronger concepts and to make them more
            confident and energetic to face any academic challenges in the
            future.
          </li>
          <li>
            To give quality education so that students not only excel in Boards
            but also in various competitive exams like NEET, JEE Main and JEE
            Advanced.
          </li>
          <li>
            To deliver the best study materials which would be sufficient for
            Boards and competitive exams.
          </li>
          <li>To help the students in realizing their true potential.</li>
          <li>
            To use modern online platforms for tests and teaching so that the
            students can feel safe and relaxed while giving competitive exams.
          </li>
          <li>
            To have a concrete doubt clearing sessions so that one will always
            stay ahead and could enhance their knowledge.

          "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the
          world."<br />-NELSON MANDELA
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the words and wisdom of the intellectual, Chanakya, a King is
          respected only in his kingdom, while the scholastic prowess of an
          astute scholar is revered everywhere. We, Pragati Classes, subscribe
          to this school of very school of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The youth of the Nation are the children of immortal bliss, and have
          the potential to change the world in ways unimaginable, given the
          nurturing and mentoring that they need and deserve – and incidentally,
          that they lack. Innumerable are the promising young minds who ardently
          desire to study ,but are destitute, and lack the finances and means to
          send them to centres of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being from an under-developed region of Assam myself, I have always
          harboured the thought that something needs to be done to tap the
          hidden potential in these promising children. This is the need of the
          hour. We live in an era of competition, and thus, proper guidance and
          mentoring have become necessary to ensure that students get to study
          in the premier institutions of the country. Also, the market has
          become littered with numerous coaching institutes that lack
          credibility but charge lacs of rupees, and fail to provide proper
          instruction or deliver satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to this, Pragati classes was started, with the idea to
          impart quality education to students. I, along with some of my
          friends, joined hands and shelled out all the means we could, so that
          we could bring this novel platform before you – a platform whose
          inception and operation revolves around the idea that lack of finances
          should not be a hindrance to the insatiable thirst for wisdom. When
          Corona was ravaging the nation, we sponsored and backed an amazing
          platform, "Pragyan Abhiyan", which provided online classes, completely
          free of cost – which soon became a hit. From 1 June 2020, we
          officially started our work or mission, the mission of having the
          students of Pragati classes in every top institutes of not only India
          but of World.

          As I myself studied in different coaching institutes and have seen the
          outside world more than an ordinary person. I sometime felt that the
          world belongs to those who have power, as strength respects strength
          and for power, education is only way. My first interaction with the
          directors of pragati classes was very fruitful and their idea and
          motto really fascinated me. The job of quality education on a mere
          price of 2000 to 2500 per month. They are providing highly refined
          notes plus video lectures and the team they hold are very enthusiastic
          and hardworking. I believe that every knowledge seeker should join
          Pragati classes to get the ultimate success.

        <p>
          In this era of competition where coaching institutes charge hundreds
          of thousands from students and sometimes spoil there future too.
          Emergence of institute like Pragati classes is a boon. I would like to
          say that Pragati classes has just started, it has a long journey ahead
          and whoever becomes part of this journey will be cherished and always
          be successful in life.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          We all know that Kota, Rajasthan is known as the engineer and MBBS
          producing factory in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why to go Kota when you have best coaching experience here itself
          in your own town?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our notes and study material are well designed to give you complete
          experience of Competitive exams like NEET, JEE, CEE and what not?
        </p>
        <p>
          For the betterment of the students we have designed our modules as per
          top coaching institutes of India(particularly Kota). We have in fact
          spent a lot regarding this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, there’s nothing to worry regarding the study materials, they are
          designed taking reference from the modules of
          Allen-Resonance-Cengage(The top Coaching institutes).
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have mentorship plan that is, 3 student per mentor. Thus
          ensuring that each student gets equal importance and gets a better
          understanding of each topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          JEE ,NEET all the national level exams are conducted in CBT mode .But
          most of the coaching institutes, even the top ones (let it be in Barak
          Valley or any other part of India), prefers pen-paper mode, so
          students generally face problems and thus commits blunder mistakes
          during the most crucial day of their life and so score sometimes low
          on the very day of exam. So in order to avoid this situations we will
          provide our students with CBT exam mode(Computer based mode).
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a number of cells, where more than 20 management staffs are
          working day and night for the classes such as exam control cell,
          software maintenance cell, result declaration cell, web development
          and management cell, editorial and innovation cell and most
          importantly the students welfare development cell. The students
          welfare development cell will not only look after the academic issues
          of the student but will guide the students to tackle problems of their
          day to day life so that they can stick to their goals and achieve
          success.
